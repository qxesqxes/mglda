mglda with gibbs sampling
MIT lisence (C) Masanao Ochi

I implement the algorithm proposed at the paper "Modeling online reviews with multi-grain topic models."
This paper was written by I.Titov et.al.

I was consulted the LDA code written by S.Nakatani very much (https://github.com/shuyo/iir/blob/master/lda/lda.py).
I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for his great work.
Thank you.

USAGE:
$ python mglda.py

from qxesqxes

I will edit some code for the chinese usage
